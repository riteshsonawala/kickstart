# Kickstart - Python Scratch Pad

This is my personal scratch pad project for all sample scripts going forward. A collection of Python code snippets, examples, and experimental scripts for quick reference and testing.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a workspace for:
- Testing new Python concepts and libraries
- Storing reusable code snippets
- Experimenting with different approaches
- Building quick prototypes and proof-of-concepts

## Current Focus

**Python only** - All scripts and examples in this repository are written in Python.

## Structure

The repository contains various Python scripts covering different topics and use cases as they are developed and tested.
